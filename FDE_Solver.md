# Ability 

1. FDE solver can be used to characterize the supported modes of light-guiding structures, to obtain results such as the mode profile, the effective index, loss, dispersion, group velocity. 

2. FDE solver can be used to optimize the power coupling between modes. 

3. FDE solver can deal with structures where the cross section is uniform ( straight or bent ) , or helical with a uniform period along the direction of propagation.

# Workflow 

## Set up <br> Run <br> Find modes <br> Analysis <br> Switch to layout <br> Modify simulation

## 1. Set up

- Add/dfeine materials
- Add structure
- Add simulation region and mesh

## 2. Run

- Switch to analysis mode
- Opens Eigensolver Analysis window

## 3. Fide modes

- Set the mode analysis parameters
- Mesh the structure
- Calculates the modes

## 4. Analysis

- Model analysis
- Frequency sweep
- Overlap analysis

## 5. Switch to layout

## 6. Modify simulation

*You can iterate the step **'Run'** to **'Modify simulation'***

*The ***built-in parameter sweep*** and ***optimization tool*** can be used to help automate this process*
